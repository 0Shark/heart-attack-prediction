• There must be a data import (predefined format and content of CSV).
• The data must be read from a file after clicking on a (menu) button.
• The data must be analyzed with Pandas methods, so that a user gets on overview.
• You may use the functions dataframe.info(), dataframe.describe() and/or dataframe.corr()
for that.
• You may also use other metrics or diagrams to do this.
• A Scikit training model algorithm (e.g. from Aurélien Géron, Chapter 4) must be applied.
• Create 1 or 2 output canvas, i.e. for data visualization
• At least 3 statistical metrics over the input data must be shown
• The app must react interactively to the change of input parameter with a new prediction with visual-
ization.
