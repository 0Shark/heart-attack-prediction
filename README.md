# Heart Attack Predictor

https://mygit.th-deg.de/ed01551/recomandation-system

# Project Description

Heart Attack Predictor is a desktop application that predicts the probability of a heart attack based on the given data.
The data is taken from Kaggle and the model is trained using the data:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/

The model is then used to predict the probability of a heart attack based on the given data.

The data is then visualised using the matplotlib library.
The data is visualised using the scatter plot, the bar chart and the pie chart.
The scatter plot shows the relation between the age and the probability of a heart attack.
The bar chart shows which factors have the most impact on the probability of a heart attack.
The pie chart shows the most common factors that lead to a heart attack.

# Installation
## Setup the virtual environment

    python -m venv .\venv

## Activate the virtual environment

    .\venv\Scripts\activate

## Install the required packages

    pip install -r .\requirements.txt

# Basic Usage

    python .\main.py

# Implementation of the Requests

# TODO
- A Desktop App with PyQT6 has to be developed. [DONE]
- A requirements.txt file must be used to list the used Python modules. [DONE]
- A README.md file must be created with the structure described in part 01. [DONE]
- The module venv must be used. [DONE]
- A free data source must be used. You may find it for example at Kaggle, SciKit (but not the built-in
ones), or other. [DONE]
- There must be a data import (predefined format and content of CSV). [DONE]
- The data must be read from a file after clicking on a (menu) button. [DONE]
- The data must be analyzed with Pandas methods, so that a user gets on overview. [DONE]
- You may use the functions dataframe.info(), dataframe.describe() and/or dataframe.corr()
for that. [DONE]
- You may also use other metrics or diagrams to do this. [DONE]
- Create several input widgets (at least 3, where 2 must be different) that change some feature variables. [DONE]
- A Scikit training model algorithm (e.g. from Aurélien Géron, Chapter 4) must be applied.
- Create 1 or 2 output canvas, i.e. for data visualization
- At least 3 statistical metrics over the input data must be shown
- The app must react interactively to the change of input parameter with a new prediction with visual-
ization.
